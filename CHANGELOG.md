Read the [FAQ] (https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/wiki/Esri-ArcGIS-FAQ) and our engineering [blog post] (https://tech.fb.com/osm-ready-data-sets/).

This release is based off of iD version 2.18.3.

#### 2020-Mar-30th
#### :trumpet: Updates
This eliminates RapiD's need to contact the facebook.com domain and instead contacts the mapwith.ai domain. This should mean fewer configuration issues for folks using Firefox or similar.

#### :sparkles: Usability
The RapiD button is no longer an AI-roads toggle- instead, a dialog opens allowing you to enable Facebook's road layer, Microsoft's building layer, or nothing at all.
